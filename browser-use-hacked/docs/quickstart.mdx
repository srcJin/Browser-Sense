</Info>

## Prepare the environment

Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to setup the Python environment.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

and activate it with:

```bash
# For Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install browser-use
```

Then install Chromium from [source](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) or run the command below (this does not install Playwright only Chromium and dependencies).

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

## Create an agent

Then you can use the agent as follows:

```python agent.py
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

import asyncio

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5")

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Go to Hacker News and find the number 1 trending on Show HN",
        llm=llm,
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Set up your LLM API keys

You need to set up API keys for the LLM you want to use and store them in `.env` file. For example, for OpenAI and Anthropic:

```bash .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

For other LLM models you can refer to the [Supported Models](/customize/supported-models) page to find how to set them up with their specific API keys.
